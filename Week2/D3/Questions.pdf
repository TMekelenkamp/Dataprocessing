1. D3 is and array of nodes which are part of the dom element. The arrays have  
    various methods on them which make you able to get and use data from the
    dom element

    select preserves the existing grouping, whereas selectAll creates a new grouping. 
    Calling select thus preserves the data, index and even the parent node of the original selection.

2. The d represents for the data that is used in the function. if there is an array
    used/created in the function the i will represent for the index of that array
    
3. d3.select("body")
    .attr("class", "barChart1")
  .append("div")
  
  d3.select("body")
    .append("svg")
    .attr("width", 50)
    .attr("height", 50)
    
4.  enter:
    is used when new data is placed onto the page
    
    append:
    is used to add extra data to a node where which had aleady been
    created with enter
    
    exit:
    removes all the nodes withing the selection that was made within the 
    statement
    
    update:
    refers to the existing data to change it when it is "updated"
    
5. when using html the bar chart will not be part of the dom, which means that the
    screen readers will not be able to access it. While using svg it is possible to
    give the screen readers access which makes it a lot more workable with for example
    d3.
    
6. assuming that the question refers to the simple example on the "let's make a bar chart" page.

d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) { return d * 10 + "px"; })
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
    
    this was the example code to create the simple bar chart. The part that was 
    appended was the new div. The div will yield the correct information form the 
    style part below it. That is where it calculates the data to an amount of 
    pixels for the width of the chart.
